# Sticky Navigation

Sticky Navigation Project
This project demonstrates a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of a sticky navigation bar. The navigation bar sticks to the top of the page as the user scrolls down, and it changes its color to white. Additionally, when hovering over the navigation items, they change their color to red, providing a visually appealing user experience.
